You are required to use either a simple text editor to write your code, or an enhanced text editor such as Brackets, linked in the Resources under the Suggested Resources heading.

Using a text editor, create an HTML5-compliant homepage with a file name of index.htm. The page should include the following page sections: 

1. Header: Include the organization name and logo. 

2. Navigation: Include links to all site pages (including the homepage). 

3. Content: This section will later be customized for each of the site pages. For the home page, it should, at a minimum, consist of information that introduces the organization. 

4. Footer: Include secondary navigation, copyright notice, or other text of your choosing. 

5. Include the following tags in the code: title, article, section, head, header, html, body, footer, nav, and doctype.

You have created your Web pages, navigation, and text that use CSS. Now it is time to concentrate on how CSS can control page layout to ensure consistency across all pages. It is also time to customize the layout of each page to appropriately accommodate content using CSS.

In this assessment, you will create a liquid layout for your site and add the final text copy to your pages while ensuring the same level of consistency across all of the pages through CSS. Liquid layouts are designed to resize the page components as the page width changes. Regardless of the browser width or device width, the user will not have to do any horizontal scrolling as all of the page components will be resized to fit the elements within the page width.

Complete the following: 

1. Amend the content section of each of the following pages using CSS as described below:
About Us: Create a CSS-formatted table with a header, rows, columns, and cells, and populate it with content.
Services: Add at least two dynamic-width columns.
Contact Us: Create multiple rows.
Homepage: Create both rows and columns. 

2. Use CSS to format how elements in the HTML document (such as the header, navigation, and footer) are rendered in the Web browser. Make sure they are formatted and aligned professionally. 

Make sure you do the following: 

1. Create a table that properly displays data. 
2. Submit code that is error free, well documented, and appropriately constructed. 
3. Use CSS to define how HTML elements are displayed on a Web page per specifications. 
4. Create custom layouts for individual page content areas. 
5. Write developer comments to describe and explain code.
